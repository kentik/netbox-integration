# Kentik Netbox Integration

Kentik and Netbox have announced the beginning ofÂ  a series of integrations between products. This initial integration takes advantage of both the flexibility of the Kentik UI and the ability of Netbox to allow the customer to create custom links for objects within its database.

In the **Custom Links** directory there is a yml file that can be used to import a number of pre-defined link options for Netbox.
